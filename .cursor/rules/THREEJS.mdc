## Three.js Coordinate System

### Coordinate System Basics
- Right-handed coordinate system:
  - X-axis: Positive points RIGHT
  - Y-axis: Positive points UP
  - Z-axis: Positive points OUT of the screen (towards viewer)
  - Negative Z points INTO the screen (away from viewer)

### Units and Scale
- Three.js uses a unitless measurement system
- By convention, we consider 1 unit = 1 meter
- Rotations are in radians (not degrees)
- Default "forward" in games typically means -Z (into screen)

### Rotation System
- Rotations follow the right-hand rule
- For Y-axis rotation (common for character turning):
  - Positive rotation is COUNTERCLOCKWISE when looking down Y-axis
  - Common rotation values for character facing:
    ```
    0       -> Face +Z (towards viewer/camera)
    Math.PI -> Face -Z (into screen/away from camera)
    Math.PI/2    -> Face +X (right)
    -Math.PI/2   -> Face -X (left)
